# Ciphertext
This program reads a text file, encrypts each line of letter texts to hide the words, and writes the encrypted text to a new encrypted file. 
This program does the vice versa as well. It reads an encrypted file, decrypts every letter texts back to its original words, and writes back to a new decrypted file. 
Very cool!
